| **Aggregation**                                   | The process of computing summaries or statistics over a set of query results (e.g., counting objects, finding min/max/mean of properties). Typically performed using the GraphQL `Aggregate{}` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **API key**                                       | A secret token used for authenticating requests to a Weaviate instance (especially for Weaviate Cloud) or to integrated third-party services like model providers (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Beacon**                                        | A beacon is a reference to a particular data object in Weaviate or inside the knowledge network. This data object in turn has a position in the vector space. Often defined as follows: `weaviate://{peerName}/{className}/{UUID}`. (For Weaviate version \< `v1.14.0`, it is defined as follows: `weaviate://{peerName}/{UUID}`.)                                                                                                              |
| **Class**                                         | A class is the former name for a [collection](../starter-guides/managing-collections/index.mdx), a container where data objects sharing the same structure (properties, vectorizer settings, etc.) are stored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Concept**                                       | Concepts are related to entities. Often you will use concepts to search in your datasets. If your dataset has data about _An Actor with the name Arnold Schwarzenegger_ and _an Actor with the name Al Pacino_, the concepts _Movie_ and _Terminator_ will find a closer relation to the first actor rather than the latter.                                                                                                                    |
| **Contextionary**                                 | Derived from _dictionary_ with _context_. Pre-trained vector space which contains vectors for nearly all words used in a specific language. The Contextionary (text2vec-contextionary) gives context to the language used in the dataset, inspired by the [_Global Vectors for Word Representation_](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe) concept. Read more about the Contextionary [here](../modules/text2vec-contextionary.md). |
| **Embedding model**                               | A machine learning model that transforms data (text, images, audio, etc.) into numerical vector representations (embeddings). This is the core component within a Vectorizer module.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Entity**                                        | An entity refers to something -often- in the world around us. E.g., _a Company with the name Apple_ refers to an entity with a relation to _a Product with the name iPhone_. Weaviate's Contextionary tries to find as many entities in your data as possible.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Fuzzy**                                         | Opposed to most other data solutions, Weaviate uses [fuzzy logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic) to interpret a query. The upside of this is that it might find answers to queries where a traditional data solution might not.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Generative model**                              | An AI model integrated with Weaviate (often via a module like `generative-openai`) that can generate new content (e.g., summaries, answers) based on the context provided by search results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **HNSW**                                          | Hierarchical Navigable Small World - a multilayered graph vector index type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Inverted index**                                | An index storing a mapping from data property values, to its locations of data objects in a database (named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from data objects to property data values).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Model provider integrations**                   | Weaviate's ability to connect with external services (like OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, Google Vertex AI) that host and serve machine learning models (Embedding models, Generative models, Rerankers) used within Weaviate modules.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Multimodal**                                    | The capability to process and understand information from multiple types (modalities) of data simultaneously, such as text, images, audio, etc. Multimodal vectorizer modules (e.g., `multi2vec-clip`) create embeddings that represent combined concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Multiple vector embeddings**                    | The capability to store multiple, distinct named vectors for a single data object. This allows representing different aspects or using embeddings from different models for the same object (e.g., one vector for content, one for title).                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Multi-vectors**                                 | Multi-vector embeddings, also known as multi-vectors, represent a single object with multiple vectors, i.e. a 2-dimensional matrix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **NearText**                                      | A search operator that takes text input, uses the configured Vectorizer module to dynamically generate a query vector, and then performs a vector similarity search based on that vector.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Property**                                      | All classes have properties. E.g., the class Company might have the property _name_. In Weaviate, properties can be recognized because they always have a lowercase first character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Quantization**                                  | Vector compression techniques (like Product Quantization 'PQ' or Binary Quantization 'BQ') used to reduce the memory footprint of vector embeddings, potentially trading some precision for significant storage and performance gains.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Reranker**                                      | An AI model integrated with Weaviate (often via a module like `reranker-cohere`) that takes the initial list of search results and re-orders them based on a secondary relevance calculation, often improving the quality of the top results.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Replication**                                   | The process of creating copies (replicas) of data shards across different nodes in a Weaviate cluster to ensure data durability and high availability in case of node failures. (Part of Clustering).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Schema**                                        | In Weaviate, a schema is used to define the types of data you will be adding and querying. You can learn more about it [here](../starter-guides/managing-collections/index.mdx).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Sharding**                                      | The process of splitting a Class's data and index horizontally across multiple nodes (shards) in a Weaviate cluster. This allows the dataset size and workload to scale beyond the capacity of a single node. (Part of Clustering).                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
